  # SMAppService keys off the bundle identifier, and an orphaned registration
  # cannot be removed from System Settings once the app is gone.

  caveats <<~EOS
    HomeSync is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, so macOS attaches a
    quarantine flag to it. Clear it once:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HomeSync.app

    (--no-quarantine is not a command-line flag on current Homebrew, and
    setting it through HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS did not stop the flag being applied
    either, so the command above is the reliable route.)

    Signing it properly needs a paid Apple Developer account.

    The synced folder and the device token are left alone by `brew uninstall`.
    Use `brew uninstall --zap homesync` to remove the app's settings too; that
    still does not touch your files, and the device token stays in the Keychain
    until you revoke it on the server.
